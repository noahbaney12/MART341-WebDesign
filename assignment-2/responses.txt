The internet allows computers to "talk" to each other in order to transfer information through a web of connectons.  The internet is a connected network of individual computers that send and receive information thousands of times every minute.
A directory is a file system cataloging structure that contains references to other files and directories.
VCS will benefit me by allowing me to view any changes made to any computer programs or websites.  It allows for easy organization and viewing of all changes.

My favorite kind of art is comic book style art.  I love comic books and love how detailed some of the artists can get drawing action scenes.
