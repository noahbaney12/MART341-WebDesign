1. The universal selector type is used to style every element on the page, element selectors are used to select all elements of a certain type, class selectors select elements that have the same function, and ID selectors allow developers to define style rules for a specific element. You would use a universal selector when you want the style to be applied to the entire document (every element), class and element selectors to style individual sections or headings, and ID selectors to style individual elements.
2. I wanted to have a vibrant color palette for the 1980s so I chose fuchsia, lime, and black. I know the black seems odd at first but I offset it with white font to really make the words pop like they would in the 80s. I combined the fuchsia and lime elements for the classic 80s neon look. The rgb values for fuchsia, lime, and black are #FF00FF, #00FF00, and 000000 respectively.
3. I didn't have too many challenges on this week's assignment as the walkthrough and examples were excellent as usual. One thing I would have liked to do better is blend my colors and sections together so that it looks nicer and neater.
