1. This class was my first experience with web development so everything that I learned in the class was new for me. I had a slight idea of the coding process that went into web development but I did not realize the scale.  Using Github took a little getting used to, but after about week 2 I started to get it and realized it was pretty intuitive.
2. Again, this was my first experience with any web design so basically everything I learned was new. I knew you could customize fonts and colors on websites but I was not aware of the sheer magnitude of options that are available for customization. I found it very useful once we got into CSS and were able to format the entire webpage by setting the styles in the separate CSS file.
3. All in all, I really enjoyed this class this semester. I rarely ran into trouble on the assignments because of the examples and walkthroughs that were posted weekly. I found these walkthroughs and examples to be very helpful when building my own sites as they provided me with a good template to achieve what I wanted. If something didn't format correctly, I would just go back through the walkthrough and take a look at the example to see where I went wrong.
