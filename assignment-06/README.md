1. There can only be one head element and one body element in a page. The head element contains meta elements, which contain information about the webpage, the viewport element, which scales the viewing size of the webpage to fit mobile devices, the title, the link, which tells the browser about other resources the page may need to load, and the style element, which establishes simple style definitions in the page. The body element is the "meat and potatoes" of the webpage. The body element contains paragraph elements, list elements, and many others to provide the bulk of the webpage. Some other main body elements are headings and the webpage title.
2. Structural markup embeds information about the structure of a document (what it is) while semantic markup is used to reinforce the meaning of what is in the document (what it means). Structural markup contains elements like headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists while semantic markup contains elements like bold and strong, italic and emphasis, sub and superscript, and strikethroughs.
3. For this assignment, I actually did the watched certain sections of the walkthrough video and then completed the corresponding section of the assignment. I found this to be a very useful method and am kind of shocked I didn't do that before. I also viewed the example of the webpage html markup that was posted to moodle and github which was vastly helpful. Overall, I thought this assignment went pretty smoothly.
