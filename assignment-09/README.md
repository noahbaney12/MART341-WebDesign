1. I actually really enjoyed learning HTML. I have little to no experience coding with HTML so I was a little worried that it would be overwhelming but for the most part I have found it fairly straightforward. I think what I enjoyed the most was looking into the different stylings and seeing all of the colors and styles you could choose from to style just about anything in HTML.
2. I am fairly anxious that the next few weeks will become increasingly more technical and I just hope that I will be able to follow the walkthroughs to succeed. I'm not sure how complicated the styling will get, but I look forward to going more in depth with it.
3. Overall, I would say I have found more successes than failures. I unfortunately was unable to finish an assignment last week, but life just gets hectic sometimes. I would say the biggest challenge for me has been time management and I usually complete the assignments the day before or on the due date. In the future I will focus on managing my time and other classes better and try to finish the assignments earlier in the week so that I have less to worry about later in the week.
