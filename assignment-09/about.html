            <h1>Necktie Instructable</h1>
            <h2>Why did I choose this project?</h2>
            <p>I had to tie ties a lot when I was in high school and would constantly have to look up how to tie one. Eventually, I had so much practice that I didn't need a tutorial anymore. Now I am just trying to pay it forward with tutorials for those who may need it.</p>
            <h2>What does it mean to me?</h2>
            <p>It means that young men and women will have access to life skills like being able to tie a tie, even if they may not have a role model figure in their lives to teach them personally.<p/>
            <h2>Where can you learn more?</h2>
